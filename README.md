## 1. Speaker at AWS Student Community Day - South TN, Organised by AWS Cloud Club, Date: 25th October 2025

Speaker at AWS Student Community Day - South TN and delivered a presentation on  **Simplifying database management with Amazon RDS and Aurora** for more than 300+ student audience at PSNA College of Engineering and Technology, Dindigul. The Session focused on Amazon RDS database and RDS Aurora. I shared how these managed database services simplify provisioning, scaling, and maintenance — allowing developers and enterprises to focus on innovation instead of infrastructure. I also discussed best practices for performance, reliability, and cost optimization when running databases in the cloud. Using  hands-on, I demonstrated an Amazon RDS database instance connected with Amazon EC2 instance.

With real-world examples and practical guidance, this session empowered students to understand how AWS simplifies database operations while ensuring security, automation, and high availability.
