*Notes & suggestions for maintainers*
- Consider moving full talk galleries (many images) into a separate markdown file (e.g., `TALKS.md`) or an `images/` gallery to keep README quick to scan.
- Replace placeholder slides/recording `#` links with final links and ensure files exist in the repo or are hosted externally.
- Add alt text to images if you re-introduce them.
- Fix the small typos in the original file (asscoiate → associate, genenerative → generative, Hasicorp → HashiCorp).
