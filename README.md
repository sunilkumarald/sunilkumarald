## 1. Title: Speaker at AWS Student Community Day - South TN, India, Organised by AWS Cloud Clubs, Date: 25th October 2025

Speaker at AWS Student Community Day - South TN and delivered a presentation on  **Simplifying database management with Amazon RDS and Aurora** for more than 300+ student audience at PSNA College of Engineering and Technology, Dindigul. The Session focused on the Amazon RDS database and RDS Aurora. I shared how these managed database services simplify provisioning, scaling, and maintenance — allowing developers and enterprises to focus on innovation instead of infrastructure. I also discussed best practices for performance, reliability, and cost optimization when running databases in the cloud. Using  hands-on, I demonstrated an Amazon RDS database instance connected with an Amazon EC2 instance.
With real-world examples and practical guidance, this session empowered students to understand how AWS simplifies database operations while ensuring security, automation, and high availability.

This event was organised by 
 - AWS Cloud Club - Anna University Regional Campus, Madurai
 - AWS Cloud Club - PSNA College of Engineering and Technology, Dindigul
